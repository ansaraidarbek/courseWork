# courseWork
This is our courseWork, that we (Aidarbek Angsar, Miras Kaidulayev, Kuanysh Tokayev) have presented in the of the senior year of our bachelor's degree at Nazarbayev University. 
The project's main aim is to create a set of tools to fix the real progress in real time. This product should be able to impact different aspects such as time management, learning, finance, sport, and eating. However, due to the time limits, we have created only time management and learning tools. Nevertheless, this project contains many interesting points such as machine learning, data structures, architecture, design patterns, etc. Here are some snapshots of our final product.
